note:

what i need to fix are
cheService
models
messages


expected broken
R resources obviously.  as compiler is fucked with what i am doing

upgrade issues

permission checks.  need to build this into utils rather than hack all the places

1: project che -> requires CheService...which is my first new task

handler
1: ActivityResuyltHandler -> che service + models
2: ConfigurationHandler -> cheService
3: Fragment Handler -> R.
4: map handler -> models
5: materials handler -> R
6: Messagae handler -> models
7: OnOptionItemsSelectedHandler -> R
8: ViewHandler -> R, models and Che service

helper
1: LocationHelper -> permission checks......
2: MapHelper -> R
3: MaterialsHelper -> R


listener
1: ViewListener -> message model...same shit

adapter
likely all R...yes


connect
permissions generally. and some models and messages obviously.  needs refactor later on.

DBHelper
models and messages - i know this anyway

Fragments
R obviously

widgets

R obviously.
